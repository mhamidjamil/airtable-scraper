ARCHITECTURE DECISION
for Airtable → Google Drive syncing:
Option— automated sync
A small script keeps Airtable tables (Patterns, Documents, Lenses, Themes) synced as CSV or JSON into a fixed Google Drive folder.
Option — Gemini API Actions
Gemini will eventually query Airtable directly through actions, so it always has the latest structured metadata without us touching anything.
Either approach means:
Gemini ALWAYS has access to:
the Airtable index (metadata, structure, pattern numbers, lenses, themes, tags)
the underlying Google Docs (full content)
BOTH datasets in a single query
We will NOT be uploading anything manually on each query.

HOW WE WILL QUERY THE SYSTEM
We use two workflows — and you should design the schema assuming BOTH workflows will be used constantly.

A. MAIN WORKFLOW — User-Friendly English Queries Through Gemini
Gemini should function like a research assistant that understands:
the structured index (Airtable)
the full corpus text (Google Docs)
our ontology (patterns, lenses, themes, conflicts, choices)
Here are the kinds of queries we expect Gemini to handle — this is a core requirement and should guide your schema:

1. Pattern-Level Retrieval
“Show me all Pattern 7s across the entire corpus.”
“List all Conflict/Choice sections tagged with ‘agency’.”
“Which patterns use the Emotional Spatialization lens?”
“Find all patterns where the question section addresses self/other boundaries.”
2. Cross-Document Reasoning
“Compare Pattern 3 across all documents. Identify contradictions, shared metaphors, repeated symbols.”
“How does the ‘externalization’ motif evolve across lenses?”
“Cluster all patterns mentioning ‘separation’ into conceptual families.”
3. Thematic Maps
“Using the Airtable tags and the source texts, generate a taxonomy of all transformation mechanisms.”
“Identify latent themes across the entire corpus — not just the explicit lenses.”
“Map relationships between lenses, patterns, and conflicts.”
4. Deep Document Analysis
“Find all instances where ‘anxiety’ appears as a spatialized object. Summarize how its representation shifts.”
“Across all docs, what are the dominant conflict archetypes?”
“Create a cross-document heatmap of emotional motifs.”
5. Pattern Dynamics
“How does Pattern 4 (Internal Friction) operate across Emotional Spatialization vs Temporal Compression lenses?”
“Which patterns consistently link color → agency shifts?”
6. Meta-Level Questions
“What philosophical assumptions repeat across the corpus?”
“Identify contradictions between lenses regarding autonomy and perception.”
“Extract recurring narrative structures from all Conflict/Choice sections.”
7. Hybrid Index + Text Queries
These require BOTH Airtable metadata AND the Google Docs source text:
“Using the Airtable index as the filter, show only Pattern 1 entries tagged ‘boundary dissolution,’ and analyze the underlying Google Docs for conceptual variations.”
“From all patterns with Lens = Emotional Spatialization, extract the spatial metaphors used and categorize them.”
This is why the index AND the docs must be perfectly aligned.

B. SECOND WORKFLOW — Exploration Inside Airtable (Database-Style Filtering)
Airtable will also be used heavily as a database.
We will use it to:
1. Filter patterns
by lens
by pattern number
by theme
by conflict type
by question type
by source document
by tags
2. Explore relationships
“Show all patterns linked to this document.”
“Show all documents that use this lens.”
“Show all conflicts across all patterns tagged ‘agency’.”
3. Manual insight discovery
This is where we (humans) notice:
repeating patterns
anomalies
unexpected connections
gaps
motifs
And once we see something interesting in Airtable, we take that insight back to Gemini.
Example:
We notice in Airtable that Pattern 4 appears frequently with ‘color metaphors’.
Then we ask Gemini:
“Analyze all Pattern 4 entries that involve color metaphors and summarize their psychological function across the corpus.”
This workflow requires Airtable to be:
clean
structured
stable
linked properly
deeply aligned with the corpus ontology
