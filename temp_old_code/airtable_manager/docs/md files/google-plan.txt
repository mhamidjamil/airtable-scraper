ARCHITECTURE
Do NOT split the documents first.
Instead:
Design a metadata schema + ontology
Parse each master Google Doc
Extract its patterns
Store everything as structured records in Airtable
Generate smaller pattern-level Google Docs friendly for humans
Run all queries, analytics, and AI workflows from Airtable — not from Drive
This gives us:
Documents → Structured Airtable Records → Global AI Querying
All machine intelligence should operate on Airtable.
Google Docs is the human-access layer.

Why Airtable Makes This Better
Using Airtable instead of Sheets/Firestore:
You get a real relational database, not a flat sheet
Link Documents → Patterns → Lenses → Themes
Add tags, summaries, sources, questions, everything in structured fields
Add embeddings or vector JSON safely
Create filtered views for reviewing patterns
Build dashboards later (themes, clusters, frequency maps)
Gemini Pro 3 can query Airtable data via API
The actual Google Docs layer stays clean + minimal
Airtable is the perfect middle layer between raw content and AI.

Step 0 — Export From Scrivener 
Before anything touches Google Docs or Airtable, we need a clean, uniform export from Scrivener.
→ Markdown (.md) with folder hierarchy preserved
File → Export → Files…
Choose MultiMarkdown → Markdown (.md)
Enable: “Use binder hierarchy”
Export to a folder
Step 1 — Design the Canonical Pattern Schema
Every pattern becomes one Airtable row with fields like:

Document ID
Document Title
Folder Path
Interpretive Lens
Pattern Number
Pattern Title
Pattern Text
Conflict/Choice
Interpretive Key Summary
Question
Sources
Tags (multiselect)
Normalized Theme
Embedding Vector (JSON)
Google Doc URL (optional)

Build the Parsing Pipeline
Choose one of these depending on freelancer skills:
Python + Drive API (recommended)
Pull each master Google Doc
Parse out 10 patterns (regex, section markers)
Normalize headings, spacing, tags
Push structured rows into Airtable via API
(Optional) generate pattern-level Google Docs
Store backlinks in Airtable
Step 3 — Airtable as the Metadata + Index Layer
Create these Airtable tables:
Documents
400 rows
Links to folders, lenses, patterns
Patterns
4,000 rows
Structured pattern fields
One row per pattern
Linked to Documents
Linked to Lenses
Linked to Themes
Lenses
List of interpretive lenses
Linked records
Themes / Taxonomy
Emerging categories
AI-generated or manual
Airtable gives you:
filtered views
grouped views
embedding storage (JSON)
automation
easy export to Gemini or other LLM pipelines
Step 4 — Global Queries + AI Integrations
Once Airtable has the structured records, we can run queries like:
“Show all Pattern 1s sorted by lens.”
“List all patterns related to spatialization.”
“Group patterns by narrative tone.”
“Which documents use the EMOTIONAL SPATIALIZATION lens?”
“Cluster patterns by similarity and produce theme summaries.”
LLMs can now:
perform semantic clustering
generate cross-document insights
summarize entire categories
produce taxonomies
find contradictions
discover hidden patterns across the corpus
All because the data is structured first.

Step 5 — Generate Smaller Pattern-Level Docs
If you want human-friendly fragment docs:
Create a script to generate a Google Doc per pattern
Auto-insert metadata header
Include backlinks to Airtable + parent document
Store URL in Airtable
These are for human browsing only, not for AI.
The AI lives entirely off the Airtable base.

Recommended Folder Structure
Keep Drive tidy:

/Master_Documents
    /Folder_01
    /Folder_02
    ...
/Pattern_Documents (optional)
    /Pattern_01
    /Pattern_02
