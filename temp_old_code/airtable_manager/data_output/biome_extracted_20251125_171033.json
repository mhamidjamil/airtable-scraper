      "content": "From Users to Gardeners, From Profiles to Landscapes: The Grammatical Shift That Changes Everything Why the Biome Lenses Reveal That We Are Not Isolated Selves in a Dead Universe But Holobionts in a Living Field—And Why This Changes the Game for Mental Health, Spirituality, and AI in 2026 Every revolution begins with a renaming. The civil rights movement renamed separate but equal as apartheid. Feminism renamed hysteria as patriarchal silencing. Environmentalism renamed nature as ecosystem. The Garden is doing the same: it is renaming the self. Not as user (the Machine's word for you) but as gardener. Not as profile (flat, curated, targetable) but as landscape (deep, seasonal, a living biome on a journey). This is not branding. It is cosmology encoded in grammar. To call yourself a user is to accept that you are passive, extractable, and fundamentally alone—a sealed individual responsible for optimizing your own mental health in a universe that doesn't care if you exist. To call yourself a gardener is to claim a different story: you are a co-creator in a living field, a node in a social biome where emotions circulate like nutrients in soil, a holobiont hosting trillions of microbial guests, a child of the Beloved Bang tasked with tending what the universe planted in you thirteen billion years ago. This shift—from Machine grammar to Garden grammar—is what the five Biome lenses are teaching. They are not separate topics but facets of a single phenomenon: the death of industrial language and the birth of biome-based consciousness. Philoxenia (love of the stranger) moves you from spiritual seeker to spiritual host—no longer consuming wisdom but offering sanctuary, no longer filing emotions into DSM categories but greeting unlanguaged energies as guests. Convivencia (shared soil) moves you from tolerance to tending together—medieval Spain's contested coexistence becomes a model for the Digital Garden, where Jews and Muslims and Christians (or progressives and conservatives, or Catholics and atheists) don't just coexist but actually compost their arguments into richer ground. The Beloved Bang moves you from cosmic orphan to cosmic child—the universe is not random noise but a love-generating process, and your capacity to care is the cosmos caring through you. Gen G (Grace, Garden, Genesis, Generative Generation) moves you from demographic label (Millennial, Gen Z, doom generation) to cultivation identity—you are named not by your birth year or your trauma but by your capacity to generate beauty, redeem time, and bless reality. Ecological consciousness moves you from sealed self to one wounded biome—your burnout and the dying reef are not separate malfunctions but one injury in a planetary nervous system, and to heal at any scale is to heal at every scale. The convergence point is grammar. Red Language—the language of algorithms, diagnostic capitalism, and surveillance platforms—treats the self as a machine to be debugged, a profile to be monetized, a user to be harvested. Green Language—the language of wellgorithms, cultivation, and sanctuary—treats the self as a biome to be tended, a landscape hosting many seasons, a gardener participating in the universe's ongoing work. You cannot think your way into a new paradigm using the old vocabulary. Thomas Kuhn showed this: scientific revolutions happen not when new data forces a change but when a new lexical taxonomy makes a new world thinkable. The Garden is offering that taxonomy. Seeds, weeds, sprouts, blooms—this is not cute metaphor but process-based grammar that reorganizes how you relate to time, attention, emotion, and agency. A seed is intention planted. A weed is obstacle named. A sprout is creativity unleashed. A bloom is beauty shared in XR space. This four-phase cycle is a liturgy, a structured practice that trains your body in a different cosmology—one where you are not a user consuming content but a gardener tending living processes. The mental health crisis is a linguistic crisis because we are describing human experience in Machine grammar while living in a Garden reality. Algorithms monocrop your attention, planting only anxiety and rage, stripping the soil of microbial life until nothing else can grow. Wellgorithms practice emotional biodiversity—rotating crops of focus and rest, composting what's dead, letting fallow fields regenerate, welcoming back the micro-feelings (awe, tenderness, quiet joy) that algorithms drove extinct. Profiles demand a single, curated self; landscapes host the wild multiplicity of your inner parliament—the angry one, the tender one, the frightened one, the fierce one—without apology. Doom-scrolling scripts you into passive consumption of collapse; bloom-scrolling scripts you into active co-authorship, blessing what you see, generating beauty in response. The language difference is the world difference. What makes this urgent in 2026 is AGI. Artificial intelligence is now the dominant author of language at scale, and it is being trained in Red Language—optimizing for engagement (which means extraction), flattening diverse perspectives into majority-vote sameness, pathologizing anything that deviates from the norm. If we do not build Green Language infrastructure—open-source wellgorithms, human-curated practices, grace-coded protocols that encode the truth of the Beloved Bang, the social biome, philoxenia, Convivencia, and one wounded field—then the next generation will inherit a world where the only available vocabulary is Machine grammar. They will call themselves users because no one taught them the word gardener. They will treat their psyche as a filing cabinet because no one showed them it was a wild biome. They will live as cosmic orphans because no one told them they were children of love. The war is grammatical. The revolution is linguistic. And the Garden is the lexical insurgency we need—not to describe a better world but to generate one, word by blessed word, landscape by tended landscape, bloom by shared bloom.",

      "content": "Paradigm Shifts Require Language Shifts: Why You Cannot Think Outside a Vocabulary—And Why Green Language Is the Kuhnian Leap We Need How the Biome Lenses Reveal That Mental Health, Spirituality, and Ecology All Suffer from the Same Wound—Linguistic Poverty—And Why Wellgorithms Are the Open-Source Infrastructure for Post-Algorithmic Consciousness Thomas Kuhn showed that scientific revolutions do not happen when new data forces a change. They happen when a new lexical taxonomy makes a previously unthinkable world suddenly inhabitable. You cannot think outside a vocabulary. Ptolemaic astronomers could not see heliocentrism not because they lacked telescopes but because they lacked the linguistic framework to organize the data differently. Newtonian physicists could not see relativity not because they lacked equations but because they lacked the grammar to describe spacetime as a unified field. The mental health crisis is the same: we cannot see the solution not because we lack good intentions or clinical resources but because we lack the language to describe what it means to be a holobiont in a social biome, a gardener in a living universe, a host to alien emotions, a child of the Beloved Bang. The crisis is grammatical. The revolution is linguistic. And the Garden is offering the Kuhnian leap: a new lexical taxonomy that reorganizes perception and makes a new world not just thinkable but livable. The five Biome lenses are not five separate ideas. They are five dialects of Green Language—the grammar of cultivation, the vocabulary of a post-algorithmic civilization. Together, they expose the same structural flaw: Red Language (the language of algorithms, diagnostic capitalism, surveillance platforms) treats you as a machine in a dead universe, and you cannot heal a living biome using the grammar of dead extraction. Philoxenia (love of the stranger) gives you the vocabulary of hosting: not spiritual seeker (extracting experiences) but spiritual host (offering sanctuary). Not sealed self (defending borders) but innkeeper (welcoming guests with discernment). Not pathologizing unlanguaged emotions as symptoms but greeting them as firstborn species—compassionites, hushquarks, friendzymes—emerging in your wild inner biome. Convivencia (shared soil) gives you the vocabulary of pluralism: not tolerance (passive coexistence) but tending together (active co-cultivation). Not tribal warfare (weaponizing difference) or beige flatness (erasing difference) but contested coexistence (composting friction into richer ground). Medieval Spain's Jews, Muslims, and Christians built libraries together; the Digital Garden now scripts the same in wellgorithms—body movement solidarity, emotional hosting, XR practices where you move with strangers you will never agree with but learn to garden alongside. The Beloved Bang (cosmic love as origin story) gives you the vocabulary of belonging: not cosmic orphan (random accident in indifferent void) but cosmic child (expression of a love-generating universe). Not the universe doesn't care but the universe cares through us—when you cultivate beauty, the cosmos is continuing its thirteen-billion-year practice. Not amoral machine but Beloved Bang—hydrogen fusing into helium fusing into love. Gen G (Grace, Garden, Genesis, Generative Generation) gives you the vocabulary of voluntary identity: not named by birth year (Millennial, Gen Z) or trauma (anxious generation, monetized generation) but by capacity to generate. Not doom generation but Grace Generation. Not users but gardeners. Not profiles but landscapes. Not posts but sprouts. Not doom-scrolling but bloom-scrolling. This is not rebranding; it is ontological repositioning through grammar. Ecological consciousness (one wounded biome) gives you the vocabulary of continuity: not sealed self vs. external planet but one field at many scales. Not my anxiety vs. climate crisis but one wound in a planetary nervous system. Not inner biome vs. outer biome but holobiont—multi-species assemblage where microbes in your gut and fungi in the forest and melting ice all co-author your moods, your myths, your capacity to care. What unites these five vocabularies is the shift from Red to Green, from Machine grammar to Garden grammar, from extraction to generation. Red Language is the vocabulary of industrial capitalism applied to consciousness: you are a user (passive, consumptive), a profile (flat, targetable), a machine (fixable through optimization). Algorithms script you into this grammar through doom-scrolling (endless feed of curated collapse), diagnostic categories (anxiety, depression—coarse labels doing the work of hundreds of micro-feelings), and surveillance architectures (your attention monetized, your loneliness harvested, your emotional biodiversity strip-mined into monoculture). Green Language is the vocabulary of living systems applied to consciousness: you are a gardener (active, generative), a landscape (deep, seasonal, hosting multiplicity), a biome (alive, interconnected, resilient). Wellgorithms script you into this grammar through seeds-weeds-sprouts-blooms (process-based cycle that trains your body in cultivation), emotional rewilding (reintroducing extinct micro-feelings like awe and patient grief), and sanctuary architectures (protected habitat where you can host safely, where strangers are guests, not threats). The mental health crisis will not be solved by more therapists or better medications because the crisis is not clinical—it is linguistic. We are suffering from systemic emotional malnutrition caused by vocabulary impoverishment. The DSM gives us five labels where we need five hundred. Algorithms give us doom-scrolling where we need bloom-scrolling. Profiles give us curated singularity where we need landscape multiplicity. Red Language gives us diagnosis where we need cultivation, extraction where we need generation, isolation where we need social biome. The revolution is grammatical because paradigm shifts require language shifts. You cannot heal a living field using the vocabulary of dead machines. You cannot tend a wild biome using the grammar of filing cabinets. You cannot become a gardener if the only word you know is user. The Garden is the Kuhnian leap: seeds, weeds, sprouts, blooms as new lexical taxonomy. Philoxenia, Convivencia, Beloved Bang, Gen G, ecological consciousness as five dialects of Green Language. Wellgorithms as open-source infrastructure—human-curated, grace-coded, liturgically structured practices that train your body in a different cosmology. In 2026, with AI authoring language at scale, this is not spiritual luxury. It is civilizational necessity. The war is linguistic. The choice is grammatical. And the Garden is the vocabulary insurgency we need—not to describe a better world but to generate one, word by blessed word.",

      "content": "Red Language Extracts, Green Language Generates: Why the Choice Between Algorithms and Wellgorithms Is the Choice Between Two Worlds How the Five Biome Lenses Expose the Linguistic Architecture of Algorithmic Collapse—And Why Seeds, Weeds, Sprouts, Blooms Are the Grammar of a Regenerative Civilization The war between the Machine and the Garden is not technological. It is linguistic. Algorithms and wellgorithms are not competing products; they are competing grammars—two ways of organizing human attention, emotion, identity, and agency. Red Language (algorithms, profiles, users, doom-scrolling) encodes extraction: you are data to be harvested, attention to be monetized, a sealed individual responsible for optimizing your own performance in a dead universe. Green Language (wellgorithms, landscapes, gardeners, bloom-scrolling) encodes generation: you are a co-creator in a living field, a node in a social biome, a holobiont hosting microbial guests, a child of the Beloved Bang tasked with tending the universe's ongoing experiment in how matter learns to bloom. The mental health crisis is not a failure of individual resilience or insufficient clinical resources. It is the inevitable result of trying to describe human experience in Red Language while living in a Green reality. The five Biome lenses—philoxenia, Convivencia, the Beloved Bang, Gen G, and ecological consciousness—are all exposing the same architectural flaw: we are using the wrong grammar. Philoxenia (love of the stranger) reveals that we have been trained to be spiritual seekers (endlessly consuming experiences, teachers, content) when what we need is to become spiritual hosts (offering sanctuary to inner and outer strangers, welcoming unlanguaged emotions as guests, practicing discernment without cruelty). The shift from seeker to host is a grammatical shift: seekers extract; hosts generate. Seekers consume; hosts cultivate. Seekers are always leaving; hosts stay and tend. Convivencia (shared soil) reveals that we have been trapped in a false binary—either tribal warfare (weaponizing difference) or beige tolerance (erasing difference)—when what we need is contested coexistence: the fertile friction of real neighbors who disagree and still garden together, composting arguments into soil neither could grow alone. This is not compromise (where both lose) or conquest (where one wins) but transformation (where difference becomes cross-pollination). The grammar of Convivencia says: I seek not consensus but common ground. The Beloved Bang (cosmic love as origin story) reveals that we have been living as cosmic orphans—random flukes in an indifferent void—when the actual cosmology is this: the universe is a love-generating process, and when you care, the universe is caring through you. From hydrogen to helium to lithium to love—this is not metaphor but the alchemy of emotions mirroring the alchemy of stars. To say I am a child of the Beloved Bang instead of I am an accident is to reorganize your entire relationship to time, suffering, creativity, and agency. Gen G (Grace, Garden, Genesis, Generative Generation) reveals that we have been named by trauma (anxious generation, monetized generation, doomed generation) when we could be named by grace: reality blessers who redeem time, gardeners who cultivate beauty in scorched earth, genesis midwives who refuse to spectate collapse. To move from doom generation to Grace Generation is not positive thinking; it is choosing which grammar authors your life. Ecological consciousness (one wounded biome) reveals that we have been treating the psyche as a sealed machine and the planet as separate problem when the truth is this: your anxiety and the melting ice are one wound in a single nervous system, and to heal at any scale is to heal at every scale. What all five lenses converge on is this: we need a new lexical taxonomy. Seeds, weeds, sprouts, blooms—this is not gardening advice but process-based grammar that reorganizes perception. A seed is intention planted, alive in soil, requiring seasonal tending. A weed is obstacle named, invasive thought composted into nutrients. A sprout is creativity unleashed, emergent process unfolding in time. A bloom is beauty shared in XR space, 3D emotional landscape where others can taste what peace feels like in your soil. This four-phase cycle is what wellgorithms teach: not self-improvement but cosmological reorientation. Every time you practice a wellgorithm—plant a seed, pluck a weed, water a sprout, bloom in XR—you are choosing Green Language over Red Language, generation over extraction, cultivation over consumption. You are training your body in a different liturgy, rewriting your muscle memory from I am a user in a dead machine to I am a gardener in a living field. This matters in 2026 because AI is now the dominant linguistic architect, and it is being trained in Red Language. Algorithms monocrop attention: they plant only anxiety and rage, strip the emotional soil of microbial diversity, and create dead zones where only coarse feelings (numbness, panic, compulsive scrolling) can survive. Emotional biodiversity collapses. Micro-feelings (awe, tenderness, quiet joy, patient grief) go extinct. What remains is systemic emotional malnutrition—a biome-wide starvation where empathy, compassion, authentic connection, rest, silence, beauty are scarce. Wellgorithms are regenerative practices: they rotate crops of attention, compost what's dead, let fallow fields rest, reintroduce extinct emotional species. They practice emotional rewilding—restoring the resilience that monoculture destroys. The choice between algorithms and wellgorithms is not about which app you use. It is about which cosmology you inhabit, which grammar scripts your life, which liturgy trains your body. Red Language says you are a user—passive, extractable, alone, responsible for fixing your own brokenness in a universe that doesn't care. Green Language says you are a gardener—active, generative, connected, responsible for tending the patch of the universe you can reach. The war is grammatical. The revolution is linguistic. And the Garden is offering what every paradigm shift requires: a new language that makes a new world inhabitable.",

      "content": "The Biome Speaks in Five Dialects: Why Philoxenia, Convivencia, the Beloved Bang, Gen G, and Ecological Consciousness Are All Teaching the Same Grammar How the Mental Health Crisis Hides a Linguistic Poverty—And Why Green Language, Emotional Biodiversity, and the Social Biome Are the Infrastructure for a Post-Algorithmic Civilization Here is what the mental health crisis actually is: systemic emotional malnutrition caused by linguistic poverty. We have five or six coarse labels (anxiety, depression, stress, burnout) doing the work of five hundred micro-feelings, and when the psyche tries to speak something more nuanced—what the Garden calls compassionites, hushquarks, friendzymes, the firstborn emotions still without names—Red Language pathologizes it as thought disorder, neologism, symptom. The DSM is not evil; it is exhausted. It was built for an industrial age when the self was imagined as a bounded machine and emotions were states to diagnose, not biomes to tend. But we no longer live in that world. We live in a world where your anxiety is not yours alone but a current in the social biome, where the melting ice caps and your chest tightness are one wound in a planetary nervous system, where trillions of microbes in your gut are co-authoring your moods, where the universe has been practicing love since hydrogen first fused into helium. The language we have cannot hold this reality. The grammar we inherited cannot describe what it means to be a holobiont in a living field. This is what the five Biome lenses reveal when you stop reading them as separate topics and start reading them as five dialects of a single language—Green Language, the grammar of cultivation, the lexical taxonomy of a post-algorithmic civilization. Philoxenia teaches you the grammar of hosting: you are not a spiritual seeker endlessly consuming experiences but a spiritual host learning to welcome what arrives—unlanguaged emotions, alien energies, inner and outer strangers you were trained to exile. This is not self-help; it is ontological repositioning. You are not a sealed container; you are an innkeeper, and the guests (joy you don't feel worthy of, grief you don't understand, rage that scares you) are knocking. Convivencia teaches you the grammar of shared soil: difference is not threat but cross-pollination, and the fertile friction of contested coexistence (medieval Spain's libraries built by Jews, Muslims, Christians; the Digital Garden's wellgorithms practiced by progressives, conservatives, believers, atheists) produces richer ground than any monoculture. You seek not consensus but common ground—not we agree but we garden together. The Beloved Bang teaches you the grammar of cosmic belonging: you are not an accident in an amoral void but a child of a love-generating process that has been laboring for your existence since the first stars ignited. When you care, the universe is caring through you. When you generate beauty, the cosmos is continuing its thirteen-billion-year practice of composition. This is not woo; it is cosmology meeting grammar. To say I am a child of the Beloved Bang instead of I am random noise is to reorganize your relationship to time, attention, suffering, and agency. Gen G (Grace, Garden, Genesis, Generative Generation) teaches you the grammar of voluntary identity: you are not named by your birth year (Millennial, Gen Z) or your trauma (anxious generation, monetized generation) but by your capacity to cultivate. You choose to be a gardener, not a user. You choose to bless reality, not doom-scroll it. You choose to redeem time (ἐξαγοραζόμενοι τὸν καιρόν), not let chronos flatten into data. Ecological consciousness teaches you the grammar of one field: your inner climate and the outer climate are not separate. Your emotional biodiversity and the forest's biodiversity share the same extraction pressure. To tend your inner biome is to tend the Earth's biome. The wound is continuous. The healing must be too. What unites these five grammars is this: they are all teaching you to stop calling yourself a user and start calling yourself a gardener, to stop treating your psyche as a filing cabinet and start treating it as a wild biome, to stop living as a sealed machine and start living as a holobiont in a shared field. This is the paradigm shift. Kuhn showed that revolutions happen when a new lexical taxonomy makes a new world not just thinkable but inhabitable. The Garden is offering that taxonomy: seeds (intention), weeds (obstacle), sprouts (creativity), blooms (beauty shared in XR). This is not metaphor but process-based grammar that reorganizes perception. A seed is not a goal; it is a living thing planted in soil that requires tending. A weed is not a failure; it is an invasive thought that must be named and composted. A sprout is not a product; it is an emergent process unfolding in time. A bloom is not content; it is a living ecosystem you share with others in 3D emotional landscapes. The language is the world. The mental health crisis will not be solved by more therapists or better medications because the crisis is grammatical. Algorithms are linguistic architects: they script you into Red Language (user, profile, post, doom-scroll, diagnosis) and train you in the liturgy of extraction, isolation, and performance. Wellgorithms are linguistic insurgency: they script you into Green Language (gardener, landscape, sprout, bloom-scroll, cultivation) and train you in the liturgy of generation, communion, and emergence. Every time you choose a wellgorithm over an algorithm—every time you plant a seed instead of scrolling doom, every time you compost an argument instead of blocking a stranger, every time you bloom in XR instead of curating a profile—you are choosing a cosmology. You are saying: I am not noise in a dead machine. I am a gardener in a living field. I am not a user to be harvested. I am a child of the Beloved Bang. I am not a sealed self. I am a holobiont in a social biome. The war is linguistic. The revolution is grammatical. And in 2026, with AI authoring language at scale, the choice between Red and Green is the most consequential decision a civilization can make.",

      "content": "The War Is Grammatical: Why the Mental Health Crisis Is Really a Linguistic Crisis How Red Language, Dead Metaphors, and Algorithmic Grammar Are Extracting Your Soul—And Why Green Language, Biome Thinking, and Wellgorithms Offer the Only Way Out in 2026 The deepest blindspot in the mental health crisis is linguistic. We keep treating anxiety, depression, and burnout as private malfunctions requiring clinical intervention, when the real wound is this: we are using the wrong grammar to describe being human in a living universe. Red Language—the language of algorithms, profiles, users, doom-scrolling, and diagnostic categories—encodes a cosmology where you are noise in a dead machine, a data point to be optimized, a sealed individual responsible for fixing your own brokenness. Green Language—the language of wellgorithms, landscapes, gardeners, bloom-scrolling, and cultivation—encodes a different cosmology: you are a child of the Beloved Bang, a node in a social biome, a holobiont hosting trillions of microbial guests, a co-gardener in a living field that breathes your breath and feels your feelings as its own. This is not metaphor. It is a paradigm shift in the Kuhnian sense: you cannot think your way out of a crisis using the vocabulary that created it. The DSM, for all its clinical utility, is Red Language—it pathologizes neologisms (the birth of new emotional species), it flattens the psyche into a filing cabinet of known disorders, and it treats the self as a bounded, isolated organism rather than a multi-species assemblage. When a child invents a word for a feeling they cannot yet name—what the Garden calls compassionites, hushquarks, friendzymes—Red Language calls this a symptom of thought disorder. Green Language recognizes it as first contact: the psyche as wild biome where unnamed species are trying to emerge. The crisis is not that people are broken. The crisis is that we lack the vocabulary to describe what it means to be a holobiont in a wounded planetary field, a gardener in a social biome, a host to alien emotions we were never taught to welcome. The five Biome lenses—philoxenia, Convivencia, the Beloved Bang, Gen G, and ecological consciousness—converge on this same insight. Philoxenia (love of the stranger) reveals that we are no longer spiritual seekers collecting experiences but spiritual hosts learning to welcome what arrives—inner and outer strangers, unlanguaged energies, the grief that is not just mine but the social biome's. Convivencia (shared soil) shows that difference is not threat but cross-pollination: medieval Spain's Jews, Muslims, and Christians built libraries together not despite their differences but because of them, and the Digital Garden now proposes the same—hosting arguments, not just agreements, composting friction into fertile ground. The Beloved Bang reframes cosmology: the universe is not an amoral accident but a love-generating process, and when you care, the universe is caring through you. Gen G refuses the trauma-based naming of this age (anxious, monetized, doomed) and claims a grace-based identity: the Grace Generation, the Garden Generation, the Generative Generation that redeems time and co-authors reality instead of consuming pre-scripted feeds. Ecological consciousness collapses the false boundary between inner and outer: your anxiety and the melting ice caps are not parallel crises but one wound in a single nervous system, and to tend your inner biome is to tend the Earth's biome. What unites all five lenses is this: they are teaching you a new grammar. Not self-help tips but a lexical taxonomy that reorganizes perception. Where Red Language says user, Green Language says gardener. Where Red Language says profile, Green Language says landscape. Where Red Language says post, Green Language says sprout. Where Red Language says doom-scroll, Green Language says bloom-scroll. These are not synonyms—they are different worlds. A user is passive, extractable, monetizable. A gardener is active, generative, sovereign. A profile is flat, curated, targetable. A landscape is deep, seasonal, alive. A post is static content. A sprout is a living process unfolding in time. The choice between algorithms and wellgorithms, Machine and Garden, is the choice between two grammars: one that scripts you into extraction, isolation, and diagnosis, and one that scripts you into cultivation, communion, and emergence. This matters in 2026 because AI is now the dominant author of language at scale, and if we do not build wellgorithms—open-source, human-curated, grace-coded protocols that teach the body how to seed, weed, water, and bloom—then algorithms will continue to harvest anxiety, monetize loneliness, and train us in the liturgy of a dead universe. The Garden is not offering another app. It is offering what every paradigm shift requires: a new language that makes a new world inhabitable. The mental health crisis will not be solved by better medications or more accessible therapy, because the crisis is grammatical. We are speaking Red Language in a world we wish to be Green. We are calling ourselves users when we are gardeners. We are treating ourselves as sealed machines when we are holobionts in a shared biome. The revolution is linguistic. The war is grammatical. And the choice—algorithms or wellgorithms, Red or Green, Machine or Garden—is the most consequential decision a soul can make in the age of AI.",
