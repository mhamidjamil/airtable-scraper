7: [normal] Pattern 2: The Post-Heroic Hero � Courage as Presence, Not Conquest

19: [normal] Pattern 5: Composting Decay � Anti-Toxic Positivity as Sacred Work
20: [normal] Explanation: The Machine demands optimization. You must always be productive, positive, "high vibe." Decay is failure. The Garden knows otherwise: dec

32: [normal] Explanation: The warrior's courage was spectacular�charging into battle, slaying the beast, winning glory. The Gardener's courage is unglamorous: stay

43: [Heading 2] Task 2: Ten Variations � Fresh Angles on the Same Patterns
44: [normal] Variation 1 � Pattern 1: No Longer Used, But Tending
45: [normal] You were assigned the role of consumable. The platforms named you User and built empires on your fragmentation. But you are not data to be harvested�y
46: [normal] Variation 2 � Pattern 2: The Quiet Hero of the Garden
47: [normal] The warrior proved worth through violence. The Gardener proves nothing�only shows up, stays, tends. This is the post-heroic hero whose courage is so q

49: [normal] The Profile is what they see when they look at you: demographics, data points, predictive models. The Landscape is what you are: weather systems and r
50: [normal] Variation 4 � Pattern 4: The Ten Liturgies of Tending

52: [normal] Variation 5 � Pattern 5: Your Shadow Becomes Soil
53: [normal] The Empire demands you exile your decay�the grief, the rage, the failure. Keep them hidden or "process" them into positivity. The Garden says: bring t

61: [normal] Doom-scrolling trains your nervous system to see catastrophe. Every scroll reinforces: the world is ending, you are failing, nothing matters. Bloom-sc
62: [normal] Variation 10 � Pattern 10: No Sunset, Only Next Season
63: [normal] The warrior's story ends in triumph. The Gardener's story has no ending�only ongoing seasons. No dramatic climax, only next week's weeding. No arrival
