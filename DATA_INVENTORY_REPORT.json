      "Will you live inside scarcity capitalism, hoarding attention and optimizing extraction, or will you step into abundance theology—recognizing that the more you generate and share in the Garden, the more fruit multiplies for everyone?",
      "Will you maintain the delusion that you don't delude yourself, or will you admit you're a poet of your own bullshit—and start writing more honest verses?",
      "Will you measure your life by Machine outputs—posts, likes, productivity dashboards—or by the fruits your generativity ripens in the Garden: relationships deepened, wounds healed, beauty offered, hope multiplied?",
      "Will you misunderstand grace as a reason to be passive, or will you let it become the very energy that powers your generative work in the Garden—turning weeds into compost, pain into fruit, wounds into wisdom?",
      "Will you package your deepest insights in respectable language that institutions can strip-mine and monetize, or will you protect them with holy foolishness—making them accessible only to those willing to look ridiculous themselves?",
      "Will you remain in amnesia, living inside a self designed by forces you cannot name, or will you remember the genealogy of interiority and step into the Garden as a conscious architect of your own inner cathedral?",
      "Will you remain trapped between sterile seriousness and numbed distraction, or will you embrace a language where mockery itself is medicine—where the laugh is the first cut that lets healing in?",
      "Will you remain trapped in Stone-Age emotional vocabulary while the Machine monetizes your nameless distress, or will you learn Green Language and participate in evolving the substrate of human interiority itself?",
      "Will you remain trapped in the sealed ego, fortified against connection and harvested by the Machine, or will you reimagine your interior as a Garden landscape—boundaried yet hospitable, sovereign yet generative?",
      "Will you speak in language that Empire can steal and sell back to you, or adopt ∫-names so absurd, so playful, so unapologetically weird that they can never be packaged as the next mindfulness app?",
      "Will you speak in terms the Machine can easily repackage and sell, or will you embrace satirical framing that protects your work from capture by making it fundamentally un-sanitizable?",
      "Will you submit to algorithmic systems that punish you for being inconsistent, self-deceived, and human, or will you practice wellgorithms that assume you're full of shit and are designed to help you compost it rather than deny it?",
      "Will you treat Seeds/Weeds/Sprouts/Blooms as mere project-management steps, or will you recognize them as a liturgical rhythm where every gesture—every seed, every pulled weed—is a prayer in motion, a co-creative act with Divinity?",
      "Will you treat your generative power as neutral productivity to be optimized by the Machine, or will you recognize every seed you plant, every bloom you tend, as a co-creative act with a God who still generates worlds through willing hands?",
      "Will you try to generate fruit through sheer willpower in a barren Machine landscape, or will you enter the Garden and abide in the Vine—letting your creativity become a conduit for generativity far greater than your own?",
      "Will you wait for clinical authorities to label you from above, or will you encounter ∫-names that make you laugh first and then—in laughing—recognize yourself and claim the diagnosis as your own?",
